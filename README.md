# Description
This Library Management Application is built using Java and JavaFX for the user interface. It uses the JFoenix library to add modern and easy-to-use design elements. Moreover,the application also uses CSS for styling, making it visually appealing and customizable.

We follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making the code easy to manage and extend. It connects to a database to store and retrieve information about books, users, and transactions. In addition, An API is used to communicate between the frontend and the database, allowing users to see details of both online & offline books.
